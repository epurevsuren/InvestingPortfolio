Data Modeling
- Our data models are designed to reflect the financial market's structures accurately, enabling intuitive interaction with financial data.

Immutable Data and Idempotent Methods
- We use the type system rigorously to prevent incorrect code from being written, ensuring our methods are idempotent.

Functional Separation
- The app's architecture breaks down the problem into distinct parts, allowing for focused development and maintenance.

Loose Coupling
- Components are developed to operate independently, facilitating more accessible updates and modifications.

Extensibility
- The design allows for quickly adding or modifying features, where new functionalities can often be added by updating data structures rather than extensive coding.

Error Handling
- Comprehensive error detection and user input validation are implemented to guide users and prevent execution errors.
